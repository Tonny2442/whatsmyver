# WhatsMyVer

WhatsMyVer is a High School Student's first ever Python script written. Really, it is a Python script that tells you your OS build, under Windows systems.

## Installation

Download master then run the test.py file using Python 3.

## Why?

Taking a Python class later in September, decided to get a head-start and start working on some random Python scripts.

## Make it better?
You are welcome to improve how this code looks or how the program acts! It really looks like crap right now.
